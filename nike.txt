NIKE FREE PRODUCTS

First of all, thanks for purchasing this method. I promise it works, you won't regret it. You MUST follow all the steps and recommendations.

STEPS:

1. Pick all the clothes you want to order and add a couple of cheap items (socks or whatever). So you will receive more than one box.



2. Place your order, preferably under $500 as they tend to be stricter with high amounts. I recommend less than $250, don't worry, this method is repeatable.



3. Once you receive your order, go on their live chat or call them up and complain that one box or some of them are empty (the ones you want to keep). They will ask you for proof, you can easily send a video of the empty box and another one which is not empty so the staff will believe in you.



4. They will launch an internal investigation, which takes 2 weeks at most (normally 3-5 days) after which they will refund you for the missing items.



5. Return the cheap items you said you received to be more trustful. You should say you don't want to have more problems with that shop. The employee yo are talking to will believe you 99%.



6. Enjoy your free stuff and repeat



Notes: this is not really dangerous, you won't go to jail, but you may be caught. In order to avoid this, here are some things you must do.
It is better to do everything on a computer rather than a phone. You should use VPN or Proxy. If you can receive your products in different places (friend's house or shops) even better.
Change your IP when purchasing or do it in a free Wi-Fi place (restaurant or library).
Do these 1 or twice a month.
Using different Nike accounts is recommended.

This is educational, I'm not responsible for you using it or if you get caught. Me careful, if you miss any step, do anything wrong or think you are not able to do it. Forget and do it another time. I hope you make money with this.
