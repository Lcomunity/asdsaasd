Thank you for buying - Bix

Product:

Go to eBay and find any steam game key. Something like this basically: https://imgur.com/PreyDL3
Buy it (yes you have to spend money on it temporarily)
Wait for it to get delivered.
Once it gets delivered, claim it to your steam account ASAP
Message the seller telling them that the product didn't work at all when you tried to claim it.
Provide them with this screenshot: https://imgur.com/CiWnlHl
If they insist it works, tell them otherwise.
I'm pretty sure eBay doesn't allow the selling of digital keys/accounts so you can use that if they still refuse to refund.
