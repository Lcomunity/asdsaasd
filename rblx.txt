 EXTRA TIPS:
1. Wear a girl outfit with a girl name, it will make you look more innocent and more people will trust you (might cost some robux but is definitely worth it.)

2.Target people that do not seem to be a trader and either got their items a long time ago or USD bought them. Check their rolimons and roblox profile to see if they are an active trader. You can still try to beam them if they are a trader, but there is a lower success rate. A few items that are high value but easier to beam include sshf and pv. Mostly because they are expensive but players who do not trade commonly have them.

3. Look for beams in hangout/vibe games and certain roleplay games. A list of good games includes the following:

Club iris
Mocap
Dollhouse roleplay
Vibe NYC
LGBTQ hangout
Kohau restaurant
Vibe place
Rate my avatar
Group plaza

4. Periodically check the server lists in a variety of games and continue searching for people until you find a good target. If the person does not fall for it, then just keep on going till you  get a good beam. I’d recommend only going for high rap players. They will fall for it less but give you better reward.
