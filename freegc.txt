Product:
Free Amazon Gift Cards.

Steps:

1. Find a seller on ebay/kijiji/craigslist (Local works better) that is selling a $25+ amazon gift card.

2. Message that seller asking to see three and ONLY three consecutive numbers so you can email amazon and make sure the card is legit, and not a spoof card 

3. Once the seller has sent you pictures of the card, take note of those 3 consecutive numbers you asked for.

4. Email/Live Chat (Live chat for better and faster results) Amazon and tell them this, "My aunt jamie told me she has got an amazon card for her birthday but after taking it out of her bag she found it the code at the back all scratched up and un readable so she gave it to me as it is no use for her. What can we do about this?" (Or something different).

5. The amazon rep will inform you they can add the card balance to your account they just need the 3 nums, hand them the numbers. (It is better if you already have a giftcard, you can scratch the numbers and take a picture).

6. Wait however long the Amazon rep asks you to wait, then enjoy your free amazon money that should be added within a few days.
