method
Directions:
-log into your Amazon account of choice (I recommend that it's not a main account) on your home IP or on LTE, do not use a VPN
-click "Account and Lists"
-click "Payment Options"
-in "Credit Cards and Debit Cards", click add a new card
-MANUALLY TYPE IN THE CARD NUMBERS, DO NOT COPY PASTE, and make sure the name you put in is the name that the Amazon account is registered under
-put in any billing address & set it as your default payment method
-Wait AT LEAST 7 days before making a purchase after adding the card but the longer you wait, the better
-Go in increments when purchasing.
    Suggested Increments:
    - First Purchase should be $20 or less
    - Second Purchase can be $50 or less
    - Third Purchase can be $100 or less
    - Fourth Purchase should be less than 200$
so on so forth. 

Tips:
-ONLY BUY PHYSICAL PRODUCTS; virtual products, ebooks, egift cards WILL LOCK YOUR ACCOUNT
-remove any actual cards so they don't get locked in case your account is placed on hold
-after making an order, wait for 2 to 3 days after the item actually ships (i.e you have it in your hands) to your house/location before making another purchase.
-having consistent activity. This is very important. Browsing Amazon every day for a few minutes (like 20 or so), adding items to your cart and removing them, debating between purchases, and showing general engagement can up your chances of this working.
-ONLY BUY GIFTABLE ITEMS. A fast way to check this is, go to an amazon item, look at its purchase section, and find an option labeled "Add a gift receipt for easy returns." These items ARE giftable and are purchasable on the card. 
-Buy Items from your List. Steps are below:
    -To add an item to your list, navigate to that item and scroll down until you see the "Add to list" option.

    - Now, click add to cart FROM THE LIST PAGE. After that, the button should change into "Proceed to checkout." Click that. (note, you can also hit "This is a gift" on the same page to save some time that way.)

    - Now, go through the normal purchasing steps. These are very easy to follow, and when prompted to make the item a gift do so.

-Buy to an amazon locker box or us a reship service. Nothing bad will happen if you ship to your house, but I'm sure Amazon keeps a log of all this stuff and it's just not good imo
-Purchase products sold AND shipped by amazon for the highest chance of the order succeeding
